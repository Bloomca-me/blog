Agile methodology conquered software development world. Nowadays it is almost impossible to land a job in our field without hearing "we are agile", "we ", and so on. But what is agile in reality? Agile is a [list of principles]() called "Agile Manifesto", which all one by one make sense, but when put together and executed, very often they become at some points questionable.

So, what it is?

list of them...

Let's go back a little bit and think why do we actually need at all, and why it is so popular. Agile is a software development methodology, the way how we develop and release our software. Before the dominant approach was the [waterfall](), which is the very strict and direct cycle without any loops -- we say that after each step everything is written in the stone and we should not go back to revisit some requirements or architectural decisions. In reality, though, this works only with the projects which are very well thought and designed -- usually, it is more close to the real life applications, like medicine, anything related to hardware, space and so on. The price of mistake in the beginning is so high, that it makes sense to spend much more time on this, discussing all possible edge cases to avoid dealing with them later. Interestingly enough, this approach still works, just not in web development.

Web development is a pretty unique beast, because of almost zero price of mistake. We can go down with out service, and (usually) it won't hurt a lot, especially if we release with simple set of rules, like deploy when majority of our customers are not using it, no deploys in the evenings and so on. Some web applications can not afford almost any downtime, but I am pretty sure they have a little bit different set of rules in order to release new version.

So, given all this info, I can say that it is not the beauty of Agile per se, rather than absolute incompatibility with other approaches. Also, one of the benefits agile gives to us is the fact that nowadays a lot of developers share very similar vocabulary (even despite the fact that almost everybody interprets them differently), and onboarding into processes of the company goes much more smooth.
